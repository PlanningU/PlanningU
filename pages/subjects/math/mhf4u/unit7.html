        <h2>Chapter 1: Equivalent Trig Expressions</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: this chapter is relatively straightforward as all you have to do is to know how cofunction
            identities work. You will get the answers to the questions quickly if you use the right formula. These
            questions are usually worth 1-2 marks.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 2: Compound Angle Formulas</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: this is a very important chapter as there are multiple ways teachers can test you on this
            concept. On a test, you might be required to use compound angle formulas to 1) solve for exact value 2)
            prove an identity and 3) simplify equations. These questions are usually worth 3 marks. We recommend you to
            memorize the formula so you don’t waste time referring to the formula sheet.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 3: Double Angle Formulas</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: this is another very important chapter as there are multiple ways teachers can test you on
            this concept. On a test, you might be required to use double angle formulas to 1) solve for an angle in a
            given interval 2) prove an identity 3) simplify equations and 4) develop a formula for sin3x and cos3x.
            These questions are usually worth 3-5 marks. We recommend you to memorize the formula so you don’t waste
            time referring to the formula sheet.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 4: Proving Trig Identities</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: this chapter requires you to utilize all the identities you learned in grade 11 and 12. When
            in doubt, always simplify the double angle and compound angle equations and always change tanx into
            sinx/cosx. This trick might help you get through a question if you are stuck. Trig identity questions may be
            worth 3 marks.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 5: Solving Linear Trig Equations</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: this chapter is rather straightforward. Note that the linear trig equations that involve
            double angle identities may have two answers. The questions that have one answer are worth 2 marks; the ones
            that have two answers are worth 3-4 marks. Make sure to find all solutions to an equation. There are word
            problems associated with this chapter. Word problems may only appear once on a test, since the focus of this
            unit is not word problems. A word problem can be worth up to 7 marks (three sub questions).
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 6: Solving Quadratic Trig Equations</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: this chapter involves factoring, double angle formulas, and solutions in different quadrants.
            Once you factored a quadratic trig equation, you solve each factor the way you solve linear trig equations.
            Make sure to check for inadmissible answers. Questions from this chapter generally are worth 5 marks due to
            their complexity.
