        <h2>Chapter 1: Exploring Polynomials</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: This chapter introduces you to the basics of polynomial functions. This chapter does not have
            major concepts besides showing you what these functions look like.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 2: Characteristics of Polynomial Functions</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: This chapter is very important as it fully explains the properties of polynomial functions.
            The concepts in chapter will recur throughout the unit. While studying, we recommend you to create a chart
            that outlines all the characteristics of a cubic/quartic function; a chart can be a more effective way to
            organize all your notes and show a comparison between a cubic and quartic function. On the unit test,
            teachers usually ask straightforward “characteristics” questions that are worth 1 mark.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 3: Characteristics of Factored Form</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: there are two purposes of this chapter: 1) to help you graph a polynomial function and 2)
            explain the fundamental concepts you need to know before learning how to factor a cubic or quartic function.
            Make sure that you are able to create an equation of a polynomial function based on the zeroes that are
            given to you. Teachers don’t test these kinds of questions often as they tend to focus more on factoring - a
            concept you will learn in later chapters.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 4: Transformation of Cubic and Quartic Functions</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: know your mapping rule. Whenever you encounter a transformation question, we recommend you to
            use the mapping rule to help you find new coordinates. Also, make sure to be able to graph the parent
            function and its transformations on the same cartesian plane. Transformation/graphing questions are usually
            worth 5 marks.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 5: Dividing Polynomials</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: We know that the synthetic method might be the easier way to divide… but teachers most likely
            will ask you to do at least one division question using long division. Straightforward division questions
            are worth only 2 marks; teachers might tweak the questions by asking you to find the dividend, given the
            quotient and the divisor. The tweaked questions may be worth up to 6 marks. Make sure to do a sufficient
            amount of practice questions to get comfortable with both methods of division.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 6: Factoring Polynomials</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: this chapter is mostly based on the previous chapter. The only new concept from this chapter
            is to identify which functions are factorable. When doing the factorability test, always start with the
            smallest factor; teachers will not make you try every factor before getting the right answer. Factoring
            questions can be worth up to 6 marks depending on the function’s complexity.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 7: Sums/Differences of Cubes</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: memorizing the formulas is the key! If you think you will forget the formula during the test,
            write them down on a piece of scrap paper immediately when the test is given to you. Always do the
            challenging homework questions in this unit; teachers will most likely test you on the difficult versions of
            these questions. Questions from this chapter may be worth 2-3 marks. Here is a little trick for you to
            memorize the formula:
        </p>
        <p>
            Sum: + - +
        </p>
        <p>
            Difference: - + +
        </p>
