        <h2>Chapter 1: Graphs of Reciprocal Functions</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: focus on studying the transformations of reciprocal functions. Make sure to be able to 1)
            graph a reciprocal function and 2) identify the characteristics/transformations of a reciprocal function
            based on a given equation. These questions are usually worth 2-3 marks.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 2: Quotients of Polynomial Functions</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: this chapter focuses on explaining the three different types of asymptotes and holes.
            Identifying asymptote questions generally are worth 1 mark; however, teachers usually ask you to find all
            the asymptotes and the location of a hole of in a function (if any) to create a 4 mark question.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 3: Graphs of Rational Functions</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: This chapter involves everything you have learned in the previous two chapters. Being able to
            graph rational functions and identify all the key elements are the key in this chapter. A combo question
            from this chapter may worth up to 7 marks. Although these questions are lengthy, they are not difficult as
            they are usually composed of 1 mark identification questions.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 4: Solving Rational Equations</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: solving the equations are usually worth 3 marks and are not the difficult part of this
            chapter. The challenge is the setting up equations for the word problems in this chapter. When in doubt,
            always put the variable as the denominator. These word problems are usually worth 5 marks.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 5: Solving Rational Inequalities</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: this is the most challenging chapter of the unit. Pay attention to when a function is defined
            and when it is not; be sure to label the intervals using the correct interval notation (soft/hard bracket).
            Most students lose marks because they do not differentiate between an asymptote and an intercept. Solving
            questions and word problems from this chapter are generally worth 6 marks. Make sure to invest in more time
            studying this chapter!
