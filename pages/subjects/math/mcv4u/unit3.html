        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 1: Velocity and Acceleration</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Studying Tips: you must know all the definitions and what each concept represents in a word problem. This
            chapter is not the main focus of the unit, and teachers will not be asking too many questions from this
            chapter. Velocity and acceleration questions are typically worth 2-4 marks; teachers usually describe a
            scenario in a question and ask multiple small questions regarding that scenario.
        </p>
        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 2: Extreme Values</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Studying tips: this chapter prepares you for the application problems in the next chapter and builds the
            fundamentals for curve sketching in unit four. This chapter is overall not difficult, but make sure to fully
            grasp the key concepts.
        </p>
        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 3: Optimization Problems</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Studying tips: this the most important chapter in unit 3. It mainly consists of 6 types of application
            questions. There aren't any shortcuts to studying for these questions except for doing as many practice
            questions as possible. Each word problem is worth 6 to 7 marks. Although they are lengthy, teachers most
            likely will not tweak the questions; these questions are really tough, teachers will not further increase
            their level of difficulty. We recommend you to develop a personalized algorithm to solve such questions;
            this way, you will know if you
        </p>
        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 4: Optimization Problems in Economics and Finance</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Studying tips: these are the less difficult optimization problems and are typically worth 4 marks. Make sure
            to know all the business terms. We recommend you write down all the business terms and write the
            corresponding math terms beside them; this will help you identify what the question is asking you to do when
            it brings up certain business terms.

            Unit Studying Tips:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>Unit test are usually out of 40-50 marks

            <li>Focus on the optimization questions from chapter three

            <li>Make a study routine for this unit so that you can review the lengthy questions at an effective pace

            <li>Create a list of questions that you are least comfortable with, and study them right before the test.

            <li>Teachers likely will ask the same types of questions they teach you without making too many
                modifications - this unit is challenging.

            <li>Try our practice test without looking at the answers; if you can score 80% and above on our practice
                test, you most likely will do well on your real test.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="coursebody">
            During the Test:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>Read all questions carefully; in this unit, make sure your answers to the long questions are organized.
                This not only helps the teacher in correcting your work, but also helps you in checking your work.

            <li>If you catch an error in the last minute of the class, donâ€™t erase your entire solution; you always get
                part marks for those long answers.

            <li>Check over your work as many times as possible - there is no rush to hand in your work early.
