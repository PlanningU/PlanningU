        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 1. Rationalization</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Chapter Tips: rationalization is a fundamental concept in finding the limit of an equation - a skill taught
            later in the course. This concept is fairly easy to understand, and assessment questions are generally
            composed of short-answer or multiple choice. Treat this chapter as a warm-up for what’s to come. Make sure
            to follow your teacher’s formatting expectations to ensure that you don’t lose involuntary marks on
            rationalization questions.
        </p>
        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 2: The Slope of a Tangent Line</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Chapter Tips: this chapter clarifies the purpose of learning calculus. Teachers normally put a few
            definition questions on the unit test, so make sure you fully understand the difference between a secant and
            tangent line. When approximating the instantaneous rate of change using secants, make sure to follow your
            teacher’s preference for the number of significant digits to use. This section is relatively easy as it
            mainly involves simple calculations (substitution).
        </p>
        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 3: Rates of Change</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Chapter Tips: Rates of change questions are usually worth 2 to 3 marks on a test. They involve the same
            concepts introduced in the final unit in MHF4U, with the exception of a brief introduction to limits.
            Teachers will not focus on these types of questions on tests as they are introductory concepts to limits.
        </p>
        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 4: The Limit of a Function</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Chapter Tips: this is the major concept of the unit and most test questions will revolve around this
            concept. Definitions, laws, graphing and formatting are extremely important in this chapter.
        </p>
        <p class="coursebody">
            Limit questions can be tested in the form of 1) finding limits, 2) word problems, and 3) graphing problems;
            they are usually worth 4 to 5 marks on tests. Make sure you not only know how to express limits using
            mathematical language, but also using graphs.
        </p>
        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 5: Properties of Limits</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Chapter tips: teachers usually test the properties of limits through communication questions and complex
            limit-finding questions on tests; they are usually worth 3 to 5 marks. There are many concepts in this
            chapter, but teachers usually mix those concepts with questions from other chapters to increase the
            questions’ complexity.
        </p>
        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 6: Continuity</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Chapter tips: Remembering the different types of discontinuities is key. Teachers usually have three ways to
            test you on continuity: 1) Graphing questions on tests and then asking you to identify locations of
            discontinuity 2) Providing a function and asking for the location of discontinuity/identifying whether if
            the function is continuous or not and 3) Finding the limit by removing a discontinuity.
        </p>
        <p class="coursebody">
            Make sure you know all the ways in which a function can be discontinuous, and under what conditions limits
            exist (even if there is a discontinuity). Focus on studying the types of questions that you are least
            confident with.
        </p>
        <p class="coursebody">
            Unit Studying Tips:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>Unit test are usually out of 40-50 marks

            <li>Focus on the big questions

            <li>Put more attention in studying the second half of the unit

            <li>Create a list of questions that you are least comfortable with, and study them right before the test.

            <li>Do all the assigned homework questions: sometimes, teachers take the exact question from your textbook
                and modify it.

            <li>Try our practice test without looking at the answers; if you can score 80% and above on our practice
                test, you most likely will do well on your real test.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="coursebody">
            During the Test:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>Read all questions carefully; in this unit, pay particular attention to formatting and rounding as there
                may be different requirements depending on your teacher

            <li>Check over your work as many times as possible - there is no rush to hand in your work early.

            </li>
