        <h1 class="course-heading">Course Overview</h1>
        <br>

        <p class="coursebody">
            This is the hardest math course offered in Ontario’s high school curriculum. This course builds on students’
            previous experience with functions and their developing understanding of rates of change. The course will
            begin with calculus. Students will broaden their understanding of rates of change, derivatives of
            polynomial, rational, exponential, and sinusoidal functions, and real world applications. The second half of
            the course is on vectors. Students will solve problems involving geometric and algebraic representations of
            vectors, and representations of lines and planes in three-dimensional space.
        </p>
        <p class="coursebody">
            MCV4U is the prerequisite course for almost all university programs related to sciences, maths, economics,
            and engineering. Students entering these programs are highly recommended to take MCV4U to ensure that they
            excel in the calculus and linear algebra courses they must take in 1st year university.

        <h2 class="course-subheading">General Studying Tips: </h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Calculus is a completely new type of math for most grade 12 students. Therefore, students are highly
            recommended to focus on understanding the concepts instead of simply memorizing the process of completing a
            question. This way, students can solve problems regardless of any modifications these questions may have.
            The same studying tips for MHF4U also apply to MCV4U: pay attention to the details and format your answers
            properly. Such conscious decisions can make the difference between passing and failing a test. Under each
            chapter, we will identify the most frequently tested questions, some minor questions, and one challenging
            question. Explanations and solutions will be provided for each of those questions.
        </p>
        <p class="coursebody">
            There are two main ways for teachers to calculate your course mark. The first method is to weigh every unit
            equally. The second method is to weigh each unit differently, but have all tests combined amount to a
            percentage (generally 70%) of your final mark. Regardless, make sure to put in the same amount of effort in
            each unit - do not slack off on units that have less weighting than other units.
        </p>
        <p class="coursebody">
            Certain teachers may also provide assessments in the form of a quiz. Generally, quizzes are worth less than
            a unit test since the material being evaluated is less challenging. Like tests, they are a good opportunity
            to improve your mark.
