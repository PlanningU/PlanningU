        <h1 class="course-heading">Unit 2: Derivatives</h1>
        <br>

        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 1: The Derivative Function</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Studying tips: this chapter begins an introduction to the first principles. This the fundamental concept
            behind all derivative rules in the upcoming chapters. Make sure you do enough practice questions to ensure
            that you are perfectly comfortable with the first principles. You must also memorize all the cases that make
            a function indifferentiable; these kinds of questions not only appear in the simple one mark questions, but
            also the slightly complex questions. Don’t worry, the first principles only appear in this unit; you will
            not need to use it again in later units.
        </p>
        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 2: The Derivatives of Polynomial Functions</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Studying tips: know your power rule! This is the most basic rule for derivatives and the easiest to use.
            Some teachers may test you on the proof of power rule; the proving question may worth at least 5 marks. We
            recommend you doing a sufficient amount of practice questions regarding the power rule. Word problems from
            this chapter are very straightforward.
        </p>
        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 3: The Product Rule</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Studying tips: similar to the previous chapter, knowing the rule itself is the most important work that
            needs to be done. We recommend you do the most challenging questions from your homework, as teachers often
            ask difficult questions to raise the test’s level of difficulty. You also need to memorize the proof - a 5
            mark giveaway.
        </p>
        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 4: The Quotient Rule</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Studying tips: similar to the previous chapter, knowing the rule itself is the most important work that
            needs to be done. We recommend you do the most challenging questions from your homework, as teachers often
            ask difficult questions to raise the test’s level of difficulty. Quotient rule is slightly harder than the
            previous two rules as it involves more calculation; make sure to do all your order of operations correctly.
            You also need to memorize the proof - a 5 mark giveaway.
        </p>
        <h2 class="course-subheading">Chapter 5: Chain Rule (Composite Functions)</h2>


        <p class="coursebody">
            Studying Tips: chain rule is the most complex and important rule; it is like a combination of all the rules
            you have learned before. Most test questions will be a combination of chain rule and another rule. Chain
            rule questions are usually worth 4 to 5 marks depending on its complexity. If you are comfortable with the
            challenging questions from previous chapters, chain rule would not be overwhelmingly difficult for you.
            Implicit Differentiation questions are also very important in this unit; although they may not frequently
            appear on a test, they are worth 4 to 5 marks. Make sure to study implicit differentiation and earn those
            marks.
        </p>

        <h2 class="course-subheading">
            Unit Studying Tips:
        </h2>

        <ul>

            <li>Unit test are usually out of 40-50 marks

            <li>Focus on the big questions

            <li>Put more attention in studying all the rules - every chapter is important.

            <li>Create a list of questions that you are least comfortable with, and study them right before the test.

            <li>Teachers often make their own test questions as homework questions might be too easy.

            <li>Try our practice test without looking at the answers; if you can score 80% and above on our practice
                test, you most likely will do well on your real test.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="course-subheading">
            During the Test:
        </h2>
        <ul>

            <li>Read all questions carefully; in this unit, pay particular attention to simplifying derivatives. It is
                very easy to make mistakes during that process, as it involves tricky order of operations.

            <li>Check over your work as many times as possible - there is no rush to hand in your work early.
