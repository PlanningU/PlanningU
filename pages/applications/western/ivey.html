            Brief Intro to the Program
        </h2>
        <p data-i18n="uwo-intro">
            Western is known for its HBA program at the Ivey Business School; however, you don’t enter the Ivey Business
            School until year 3, and you have to meet many challenging requirements in year 1 & 2 to successfully make
            your way to Ivey . Therefore, Ivey designed the AEO status system to 1) recognize high achieving high school
            student leaders and 2) grant them the opportunity to enter Ivey with a higher chance and less burden.
        </p>
        <p data-i18n="uwo-intro2">
            The AEO application is very comprehensive and competitive. You must edit your written work thoroughly before
            submitting.

            High School Prerequisites
        </h2>
        <ol>

            <li data-i18n="uwo-prereq">They require a minimum of 90% for top six courses; however, we recommend you to
                maintain at least 93%
                and higher to be competitive.

            <li data-i18n="uwo-prereq2">Grade 12 English and two maths. We recommend you taking Calculus and Vectors if
                you are going into a
                science, engineering, or business major.

            Essay Topics:
        </h2>
        <ol>

            <li data-i18n="uwo-essay">Select TWO activities that you feel demonstrate your leadership abilities best.
                Focus your description
                on elements that demonstrate: leadership, teamwork, initiative, achievement, commitment and breadth.
                Each description should focus on one activity only. You must add two activities to this section to be
                able to submit your application.
            </li>


            <li data-i18n="uwo-essay2">Character in leadership matters. At Ivey, character is defined as an amalgam of
                virtues, values and
                certain traits. Character speaks to who a person is rather than what they are able to do. Some would say
                the virtues of<strong> courage, humility and humanity</strong> are equally as important as the virtues
                of <strong>accountability, drive and integrity.</strong> Do you think this is true? Relate your answer
                to your experiences in the activities you've included as part of your application.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p data-i18n="uwo-essay3">
            Tips: make your answer personal. The admissions officer wants to see what kind of person you are through
            your answer. Make sure that your answer is specific, and not holier-than-thou. Make sure that your answer
            sounds natural; you are doing it for the greater good, not for the sake of the application or your personal
            benefits. Finally, don’t try to ‘teach’ the admission officers what it means to be a leader.

        <h2 data-i18n="ec">
            Extracurricular Involvement Recommendations
        </h2>
        <ol>

            <li data-i18n="uwo-ec">Make sure you have at least four significant EC involvements that you play a
                leadership role within.

            <li data-i18n="uwo-ec2">Make sure your EC is diverse: Athletics/arts, school related, volunteering, and
                other types of
                competitions you do outside of school.

            <li data-i18n="uwo-ec3">Be ready to talk about your experiences - any challenges you faced, failure stories
                you had, and
                successful accomplishments you earned.
            </li>
            <li data-i18n="uwo-ec4">In your essay, be sure to identify the important elements Ivey is looking for. When
                writing the rough draft for your essay, make sure to first lay out which experiences match with which
                leadership elements mentioned in the essay topic.
