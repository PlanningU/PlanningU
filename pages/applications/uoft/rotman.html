            Brief Intro to the Program
        </h2>
        <p data-i18n="rotman-intro">
            Rotman Commerce at the U of T does not have an as competitive entry requirement as Ivey or Queens Commerce.
            However, the supplementary materials you have to submit for Rotman is rather different than Ivey or Queens.
            Like other programs at U of T, it is easier to get into Rotman Commerce than graduating from it.
        </p>
        <h2 data-i18n="prereq">
            High School Prerequisites
        </h2>


        <p data-i18n="rotman-prereq">Grade 12 English, Calculus, and one other math course</p>

        <p data-i18n="rotman-prereq2">Your grades are very important for a U of T admissions officer. We recommend
            that you maintain at
            least
            90% to be competitive. Higher the grades you have, higher the chance you will receive earlier
            acceptance.</p>

        <p data-i18n="rotman-prereq3">Do not take any prerequisite courses in summer school as Rotman may penalize
            you for an admission
            average reduction.
        </p>

        <h2 data-i18n="suppapp">

        <p data-i18n="rotman-suppapp">The entire supplementary material is in the form of a “semi-live” interview.

            stream video responses and answer written questions, mostly on the spot.</p>

        <p data-i18n="rotman-suppapp1">The Process is as follows:</p>

            <li data-i18n="rotman-suppapp-l1">Video response: introduce who you are and one thing you are

            Extracurricular Involvement Recommendations
        </h2>


            <p data-i18n="rotman-ec">Rotman focuses more on your marks instead of your EC involvement. However, we
                still recommend you to be
                ready to talk about some great accomplishments you had for the interview:</p>
                <ol>

                    <li data-i18n="rotman-ec-l1">A leadership position in large community organizations

                    <li data-i18n="rotman-ec-l2">Show that you are persistent with your involvements; admissions
                    officers like to to see
                        dedication and consistent effort.

                    <li data-i18n="rotman-ec-l3">Take initiatives in founding new clubs and organizations etc. It can
                    be within your school
                    or in
                        the community.

                    <li data-i18n="rotman-ec-l4">Focus on business related involvement. Make sure you have quantifiable
                    metrics
                    for success.

                    </li>
