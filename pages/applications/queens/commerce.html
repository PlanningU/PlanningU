            students per year. Queens’ Commerce graduates are highly employable; according to Queens’, 98% of its

                course

            <li data-i18n="qcomm-prereq2">The cut off top 6 course average is 87%; as long as your average is above
                this cut off line, they treat
                you indifferently in terms of your academic performance. The admission focuses more on your EC
                involvement instead of your grades.

            <li data-i18n="qcomm-prereq3">They might reject someone with a 98% average and accept someone with an 89%
                average, simply due to the
                difference between the two applicant’s EC involvement.
