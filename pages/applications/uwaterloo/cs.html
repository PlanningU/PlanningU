        <h2 data-i18n="progintro">Brief Intro to the Program</h2>


        <p data-i18n="uw-intro">
            The computer science program at the University of Waterloo is one of the most renowned in North America. It
            is a rigorous 4 years of study, with the coop option adding an additional year of coop experience. Being so
            renowned, competition is high for a spot in the program. Especially for the year 2021, it is predicted that
            less students than usual will be accepted to make up for the 200% over acceptance in 2020.

        <h2 data-i18n="prereq">High School Prerequisites</h2>


        <p data-i18n="uw-prereq">

            Admissions averages start from low 90s. In practice an average over 95 is needed to stay competitive. Make
            sure to not take these courses in summer school or night school as that is penalized by an admissions
            average reduction.
        </p>
        <h2 data-i18n="suppapp">Supplementary Application</h2>


        <p data-i18n="uw-suppapp">
            The only supplementary application is the AIF (Admissions Information Form). This is valued quite highly in
            the admissions process. The AIF will ask you to state your extracurricular involvement, class grades,
            contest scores, and write essay responses. The AIF will be scored by numerous judges, and given a score from
            1 to 5 based on how well it is written and what is written on it. This will be added to your admissions
            average to rank you among other applicants.
        </p>
        <p data-i18n="uw-suppapp2">
            The AIF will consist of:
